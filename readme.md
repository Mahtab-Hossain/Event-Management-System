# Event Management System

## Overview
The Event Management System is a web-based application that allows users to create, manage, and view events. Users can register for events, and admins can generate reports. The system ensures secure user authentication, client-side and server-side validation, and provides a responsive user interface.

## Features
- **User Authentication**: Secure login and registration with password hashing.
- **Event Management**: Authenticated users can create, update, view, and delete events.
- **Attendee Registration**: Users can register for events, with capacity limits enforced.
- **Event Dashboard**: Displays events in a paginated, sortable, and filterable format.
- **Event Reports**: Admins can download attendee lists for specific events in CSV format.
- **Role-Based Access Control**: Admins can manage all events, view reports, and register other admins. Regular users can manage their own events and view attendee lists.
- **Responsive Design**: The application is mobile-friendly and uses Bootstrap for a responsive UI.
- **Notifications**: Toastr notifications for user feedback.
